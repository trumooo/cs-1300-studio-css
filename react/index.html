            <h2>Making Reactive Sites</h2>
            <p>I have made a few different design webpages, yet I think its time I take it up a notch. I need to work on
                dynamic websites.</p>
            <a>I want this project to ultimately culminate in a sortable, filterable webpage with some sort of
                interactable aggregate.</a>
            <hr>
            <p>This journal entry will start with a idea generation, then move to a competitve analysis, and proceed to
                a development summary.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section-border">
            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>There are plenty of different websites I could make that fullfil the requirments. When quickly listing
                some rough ideas I was able to come up with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Movies</li>
                <li>Groceries</li>
                <li>Hotels</li>
                <li>Bakery</li>
                <li><b>Honey</b></li>
                <li>Podcasts</li>
                <li>Diverse-owned goods</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, I know one of those is very different then the rest, but I think that is where it really shines. I
                should say that I am a beekeeper. This means that I know a bit about the industry and the major honey
                producers. The industry is full of a few massive companies and then many mom and pop shops. </p>
            <p>I thought it could be interesting to design a system to help people support the smaller producers. They
                both have better a better product and usually struggle to find customers—and end up giving away a lot of
                honey as gifts.</p>
            <p>But, local honey is great. It can help people with their seasonal allergies, and often is made up of many
                more pollen sources than the big producers. These hints of flavor make the taste of the honey more
                complex and make it pair well with certain food groups.</p>
            <p>So, I wanted to theme my aggregator and list to be based on a market place for small producer's honey.

            <h1>The Compititon</h1>
            <p>In order to best understand how my website can shine, I need to look at the current methods that exist. I
                want to start with a competitive analysis of the major multi-vendor sellers and create a feature
                comparison chart. For the sake of this project, I am just going to highlight three sellers but in a real
                scenario I would expand this to many more. </p>
            <p>Before starting, I want to highlight the five factors that I will be judging these websites on.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Intuitive</li>
                <li>Regional Breakdown</li>
                <li>Highlights Small Producers</li>
                <li>Educates Users</li>
                <li>Helpful Reviews/Comments</li>
            </ol>
            <a>I chose these factors because I believe that they best align with the idea. This is to say that our
                company's key metric should be number of sales from small producers, and these are the factors that
                underly that statistic.</a>
            <p>The three websites I chose to complete our competitve comparison chart with are 1. <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/"><b>Amazon</b></a>, 2. <a
                    href="https://honey.com/honey-locator/#"><b>Honey</b></a>, and 3. <a
                    href="https://www.localhoneyfinder.org/index.php#states"><b>Local Honey Finder</b></a>.</p>
            <img class="image-small" alt="amazon search for honey" src="./assets/amazon.png" />
            <img class="image-small" alt="honey search on honey.com" src="./assets/honey.png" />
            <img class="image-small" alt="local honey finder.com" src="./assets/local.png" />
            <p>The primary websites these ways differ is how they force the user to sort their products. Amazon gives
                the users many different factors that they can filter upon. The other two only really give the user the
                ability to search by geographic region. Amazon is product first; the other two are fitlering first.</p>

                <h3>Comparison Chart Analysis:</h3>
                <p>I think this competitive analysis really outlined that there is a way to greatly expand upon the
                    current options. No method is perfect. They either are convoluted / too geographically oriented. On
                    the other hand, they are standard shopping methods not modified to take in consideration of honey’s
                    nuances. </p>
                <p><b>Amazon's</b> most effective factors are its intuitive design and filtering system. However, it
                    doesn't allow you to easily break down results by geographic origin. There is a clear heirarchy and
                    design cohesion.</p>
                <p><b>Honey's</b> most effective factors are its massive map. Yet, there are now ways of easily buying
                    the products on the website. It only redirects you. There is a map like interface which doesn't seem
                    entirely cohesive to the shopping experience.</p>
                <p><b>Local Honey Finder</b> has similar problems. Additionally, it doesn't effectively educate the
                    users on the nuances of honey's many details. It doesn't tell the user the specific pollon breakdown
                    or flavor notes that honey.com can educate the user. It's work flow is unclear and will likely lead
                    to the user having frantic mouse movement. </p>

            <h1>Starting to Redesign</h1>
            <p>Using this information, let's design the key features needed for this website:</p>
            <h4>1. A way of educating the user about each type of honey.</h4>
            <h4>2. The ability to filter the honeys by pairings.</h4>
            <h4>3. The ability to regionally organize the honeys.</h4>
            <h4>4. The ability to sort by both price and ounce.</h4>
            <h4>5. Understandable UI/UX that matches standard shopping behavior.</h4>
            <p>I believe these features will successfuly differentiate from the current alternatives.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>The Design</h1>
        <p></p>

        <div class="section-flat">
            <h3>Honey Item</h3>
            <p>The card for each honey product is the most important design for this project. So, I decided to use a
                fairly standard minimalist design. I wanted it to be professional and serious. The image should take up
                the top third of the image followed by some details and then an add button. I also went ahead and
                included a remove from cart button. </p>
            <p>My primary colors were going to be white, black, and two shades of orange. This would keep the website
                looking sleek yet appropriately themed.</p>
            <p>I ultimately settled on this design. I like the body text because it helps educate the user on what to
                look for in their honey. I think the drop shadow gives the card a feeling of clickability. To further
                this I added some hover effects on the sub-buttons. </p>
            <img class="image-small" alt="image of honey card" src="./assets/figmacard.png" />
            <p>This was the figma mock-up that I made for the default honey card. I then translated it into the
                following in html and css:</p>
            <img class="image-small" alt="image of honey card" src="./assets/honeycard.png" />
        </div>

        <div class="section-shadow">
            <h3>Final Website Mockup</h3>
            <img alt="Image of final honey website" src="./assets/final.png" style="width: 900px;" />
            <p>This is the final version of the mock up website. It is fully interacable and sortable. Please check it
                out at <a href="https://honey-site-green.vercel.app/">https://honey-site-green.vercel.app/</a></p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="section-flat">
            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>In the end I like how the website turned out. I do think the cart could use some work, but the main
                purpose of this project was not visual design but product design. This website has all of the features
                that the competitve analysis determined it should. Specifically, it is both intuitive and contains the
                ability for geographic breakdown. I also added a feature, so users can sort by organic honeys. Lastly,
                the user can also filter by pairings to better select their ideal honeys. </p>
            <p>This project also taught me a ton about react and how interacable websites can be created. The website is
                also scores a 97 percent for accessibility which is always fantastic!</p>
