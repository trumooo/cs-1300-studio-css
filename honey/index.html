            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>I am an amateur beekeeper. That is not a problem; it's just the reason I know there is a problem.
                Currently, the honey market is dominated by a few major producers. This has led to most Americans having
                Californian honey. However, buying honey from smaller producers can have many positive effects.</p>

            <p><b>First,</b> it helps keep bee populations high across the US.</p>
            <p><b>Second,</b> it is better for the bees! Bees like multiple sources of pollon, but large producers typically just have their bees monocrop farms.</p>
            <p><b>Third,</b> a variety of pollen sources leads to a unique tasting product which results in many ideal
                food/honey pairings.</p>
            <p><b>Fourth,</b> eating local honey can reduce your allergies!</p>
        </div>
        <p> <b>The goal of this project is to both conduct research on current players within the honey market and develop a minimum viable product (MVP) which could be used to help validate that there is a consumer interest in my idea.</b></p>
        <div class="brainstorm">
            <h3>The Competition</h3>
            <p>In order to build the best MVP, I needed to understand the current market. In other words, I needed
                to look at the other ways people find honey regionally. </p>
            <p>For my competitive analysis, I first wrote down the five main factors that I will be judging competitors
                by. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Intuitive</li>
                <li>Regional breakdown</li>
                <li>Highlights small producers</li>
                <li>Educates users</li>
                <li>Helpful reviews/comments</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I chose these factors because I believe that they best align with the concept. This is to say that my
                company's KPI will be the number of sales by small producers, and these are the factors that drive this
                statistic.</p>
            <p>For this first round, I specifically focused on generating new ways to interact with the existing
                technology.</p>
            <div class="side">
                <img class="image-small" alt="amazon search for honey" src="./assets/amazon.png" />
                <img class="image-small" alt="honey search on honey.com" src="./assets/honey.png" />
                <img class="image-small" alt="local honey finder.com" src="./assets/local.png" />
            </div>
            <p>The three websites I chose to focus on are 1. <a
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/"><b>Amazon</b></a>, 2. <a
                    href="https://honey.com/honey-locator/#"><b>Honey.com</b></a>, and 3. <a
                    href="https://www.localhoneyfinder.org/index.php#states"><b>Local Honey Finder</b></a>.</p>
            <p>These websites were highlighted because of the significant role each plays within the honey market.
                Amazon is the largest online seller of honey, while Honey.com and Local Honey Finder are smaller
                providers with a similar aim to my own store.</p>

            <p>This analysis shows the niche that my marketplace could fill. No current method is perfect. They either
                are convoluted / too geographically oriented, or they are standard shopping methods not
                modified to take into consideration the nuances of honey.</p>
            <p><b>Amazon's</b> most effective factors are its intuitive design and filtering system. However, it doesn't
                allow you to easily break down results by geographic origin. They do have a clear hierarchy and design
                cohesion. They list products as "local honey," but it is unclear where they are local to.</p>
            <p><b>Honey.com's</b> most effective feature is its map. Yet, there is no way to buy the
                products on the website. It simply redirects you. There is a map-like interface which doesn't seem
                entirely cohesive to the shopping experience.</p>
            <p><b>Local Honey Finder</b> has similar problems. It also is lacking education materials on the nuances of
                honey's food pairings and other details. Its workflow is also unclear and will leads to a poor user
                experience. </p>

        <div class="styleguide">
            <h3>Starting to Build an MVP</h3>
            <p>Using this information, let's design the key features needed for this website:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A way of educating the user about each type of honey.</li>
                <li>The ability to filter the honeys by pairings.</li>
                <li>The ability to regionally organize the honeys.</li>
                <li>The ability to sort by both price and ounce.</li>
                <li>Understandable UI/UX that matches standard shopping behavior.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With these features, my target customer is revealed to be someone newly interested in food pairings, environmentally conscious, and with some disposable income. I believe that the ability to sort by quantity is distinctly relevant to this user because they are likely only going to want a small amount the first time they try a product.</p>
            <p>Once I finish up my MVP, this will be the target customer that I would like to test the application upon, to see if my idea validates an unmet need.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="pit">
            <h2>Propagating the Product</h2>
            <p>For this product, the most important feature was is the card. My design took inspiration from
                Amazon's minimalist system and Honey.com's educational resources. In particular, I wanted the card to
                not only have both an image of the product, but also information on the honey's nuances and pairings.</p>
            <p>My primary colors were chosen to support the minimalist, clean design. In the end, I went with a white,
                black, and two shades of orange.</p>
            <p>After doing the sketch of the card in Figma (left), I implemented it in HTML and CSS (right): </p>

                <div class="side">
            <img class="image-small" alt="Figma of honey card" src="./assets/figmacard.png" />

            <img class="image-small" alt="final honey card" src="./assets/honeycard.png" />
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="high-fi">
            <h2>Selling the Honey</h2>
            <p>Using a similar process, I went through the remaining website features until I reached the design below:
            </p>
            <p>Here, the main features of the website are the filtering and sorting components.</p>
            <p>These allow the user to educate themselves on various elements that they otherwise would have likely
                ignored.</p>

                With this, I had successfully created a MVP for my idea. Now, it was onto the next step—but I'll save that for another day.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Market Research:</b> My market research was critical for identifying an open niche within the online honey market. I noticed a strong consumer interest in locally sourced, sustainable products that cannot be provided by mainstream retailers. By focusing on these elements, my platform supports small businesses and appeals to an increasingly environmentally-conscious demographic that values the origin of their food.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Quality:</b> The purpose of this project was to get a demo website to help conduct further testing. I believe that this was a success. Some of the design choices of the website—particularly the cart—will need to change, but the first step before building a product is to see if people even want it.
