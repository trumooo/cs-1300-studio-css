        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Timeline: 2-weeks</p>
        <p>Bagel Gourmet is the name of my favorite place to grab a hot breakfast sandwich.</p>
        <p>The only problem is that while their food is great, their website leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
        <img class="image" alt="bagel gourmet old website" src="assets/bagelgourmet.png"/>
        <div class="note"><p><i>Update: Their website has been actually taken down since I did this project, but feel free to look at it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230329033832/http://bagelgourmetcafe.com/">here</a>.</i></p>
        <p>I thought this website would definitely deter prospective customers who might think the store is going to be old and outdated based on their website, so they need a website that matches the quality of their food.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="problems">
        <h3>What specifically doesn't work about the old website?</h3>
        <p>It is one thing to say that the website is messy and has poor style, but I wanted to dig deeper.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no way to build a cart and order.</li>
            <li>There is no consistent coloring or sizing.</li>
            <li>There are no clear and distinct navigational tools.</li>
            <li>The layout is asymmetrical and heavily weighted.</li>
            <li>There is no consistent HTML tag hierarchy.</li>
            <li>This is a menu for a bagel restaurant and it starts with Mexican options.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These pain points helped me understand the specific parts of the website that I wanted to improve. With them listed out, I can better understand how to modernize this website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="brainstorm">
        <h3>Brainstorming New Ideas</h3> 
        <p>Now, I knew what I wanted to improve upon, but I didn't know what I wanted the new website to look like. I only knew what it couldn't be.</p>
        <p>I sat down and quickly iterated through a few rough sketches. My main thought when completing these was that I wanted them to be modern and concise.</p>
        <img class="image" alt="nine sketches of new websites" src="assets/ninealternatives.png"/> 
        <p>The two ideas that I was really drawn to were #2 and #3, located in the top row. The grid-based ordering system was a simple, yet clean design that could be applied well to almost any store.</p>
        <p>But, I did think that the universality of the design might be a downside. I wanted to create something that represented the great, unique quality of the store, and I wasn't quite sure that the grid design would do that.</p>
        <p>This is why #3 stood out to me. In #3, the bagel would be visually filled by your toppings as you create your bagel sandwich.</p>
        <p>The idea of ordering your food using a text-based menu with a strong visual metaphor was very compelling.</p>
        <p>With these details, I realized that I could combine them into different segments of the user experience.</p>            
    </div>
    <div class="wireframing">
        <div class="wireframe mobile">
        <h3>How the Sandwich Gets Made</h3>
        <p>Next, I took a step back and thought about how users would access the website.</p>
        <p>After interviewing customers, I heard that most customers would like to order ahead from home.</p>
        <p>Customers mentioned wishing to order from either mobile or desktop devices, so I knew that my website would have to include an adaptive design.</p>

            <h4>Mobile Site</h4>
            <div class="wireframe mobile images">
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel selector for mobile" src="assets/mobiledrawing1.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel selector for mobile after tap" src="assets/mobiledrawing2.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel filler when empty" src="assets/mobiledrawing3.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel filler when full" src="assets/mobiledrawing4.png"/>
            </div>
            <p>For the mobile display, I wanted to have a scrollable menu as the central display. I collapsed most of the less used features into accessory buttons that were spaced around the edge of the screen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wireframe tablet">
            <h4>Tablet Site</h4>
            <div class="wireframe tablet images">
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel selector for tablet" src="assets/tablet1.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel selector for tablet after tap" src="assets/tablet2.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel filler when empty" src="assets/tablet3.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel filler when full" src="assets/tablet4.png"/>
            </div>
            <p>I wanted the tablet display to be more comprehensive. Here, the larger screen resolution can be used to have a permanent navigation bar on the side, while the main section can be used to find items.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wireframe desktop">
            <h4>Desktop Site</h4>
            <div class="wireframe desktop images">
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel selector for desktop" src="assets/desktop1.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel selector for desktop after tap" src="assets/desktop2.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel filler when empty" src="assets/desktop3.png"/>
                <img class="image-small" alt="drawing of bagel filler when full" src="assets/desktop4.png"/>
            </div>
            <p>The desktop display needed to provide the user with the most information. To do this, I brought the bag to the left side of the screen. I also transitioned to a horizontal navigation bar to further the visual hierarchy of the website.</p>
        </div>
    
    </div>
    <div class="styleguide">
        <h3>Final Touches</h3>
        <p>With my wireframes created, I now better understood what my final design would look like. However, the wireframe processes did make me want to increase the visual similarity across devices.</p>
        <p>As a result, I created a style guide which defined what the key components of my website would look like. </p>
        <div class="styleguideimages images">
            <img class="image" alt="Style Guide page 1" src="assets/styleguide1.png"/>
            <img class="image" alt="Style Guide page 2" src="assets/styleguide2.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>The fonts and elements were chosen to evoke the look of the brick and mortar store. This would help the store have a unified brand experience both online and in-person.</p>
        <p>Specifically, I opted for a blue-toned website which matches Bagel Gourmet's store interior. I also went for a medium, rounded, sans-serif font to emphasize the casual, updated nature of the website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="high-fi">
        <h2>Orders Up</h2>
        <div class="mobile_hi">
            <h3>Mobile</h3>
            <img class="image-large" alt="mobile version high fidelity design" src="assets/bagel-hi.png"/>
        </div>
        <div class="tablet-hi">
            <h3>Tablet</h3>
            <img class="image-large" alt="tablet version high fidelity design" src="assets/tablet-hi.png"/>
        </div>
        <div class="desktop-hi">
            <h3>Desktop</h3>
            <img class="image-large" alt="Desktop version high fidelity design" src="assets/desktop-hi.png"/>
        </div>
        <p>The final high fidelity designs show the progress of the website. However, I still was struggling to fully understand the mobile-user experience, so I decided to make it interactable.</p>
        <video class="video-player" autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="assets/movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>
        <p>I was initially hesitant about using the sandwich filler feature on a mobile device, but user testing on store customers made me feel much more confident about its implementation.</p>
        <p>Users specifically mentioned how the visual design both "makes sense" and makes the process more "fun!"</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>To get a sense of what the final HTML and CSS of the website would look like, I decided to create an adaptive version of the <a href="https://trumooo.github.io/bagel/"><b>homepage</b></a>.</p>
    </div>
</main>

    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>
            <p><b>Accessibility:</b> I believe that bagels should be for everyone! 
                However, the original website was largely inaccessible. 
                It had limited visual hierarchy, unclear color contrast, and miscategorized HTML tags. In all, it scored a 65 in Lighthouse.
             I was able to help fix these issues. Ultimately, my version scored a 100 in Lighthouse and used clear HTML tags.
            </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><b>Functionality:</b> The new website is user-focused. This means that I assume that individuals coming to the website are specifically looking for bagels. As a result, I removed the Mexican section of the menu to streamline the ordering process.
